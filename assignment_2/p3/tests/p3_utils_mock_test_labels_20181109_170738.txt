An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .|4
This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .|0
I like it .|1
It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .|1
A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .|4
A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .|2

The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''|4
Just a Kiss is a just a waste .|3
A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .|0

The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .|2
Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .|2
It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .|4
An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .|3

As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .|0
Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .|2
The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .|3
It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .|0
This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .|1
