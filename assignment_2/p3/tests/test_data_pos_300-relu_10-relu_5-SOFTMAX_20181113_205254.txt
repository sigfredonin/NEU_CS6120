Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .|1
What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .|1
... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .|3
Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .|3
This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .|1
Half Past Dead is just such an achievement .|3
Feels shrill , simple and soapy .|3
Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichÃ©d white-trash situation imaginable .|3
No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas .|3
The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .|3
Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .|3
eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .|1
Boy oh boy , it 's a howler .|3
Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .|1
The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .|3
However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .|3
There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .|3
The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .|1
So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .|3
Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .|3
If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .|1
Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .|3
A film with a great premise but only a great premise .|3
Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .|1
-LRB- Kirshner wins , but it 's close . -RRB-|3
An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .|3
This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .|1
I like it .|1
It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .|1
A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .|3
A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .|1
Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .|3
The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''|3
Just a Kiss is a just a waste .|1
A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .|1
This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .|1
It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .|1
Writer-director Stephen Gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the English call ` too clever by half . '|1
The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .|1
Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .|3
Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .|1
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .|1
The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .|1
Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .|3
In the end , The Weight of Water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on Showtime 's ` Red Shoe Diaries . '|1
The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .|1
Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?|1
Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .|3
A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog .|3
Lawrence should stick to his day job .|1
Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie|1
The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .|3
Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .|1
Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .|1
Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .|1
As plain and pedestrian as catsup --|3
I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but I ca n't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary .|1
Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .|1
One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .|3
... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .|3
Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .|1
The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .|1
Never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .|1
After a while , Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .|1
The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .|3
This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .|1
When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .|1
The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .|1
The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .|3
It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .|1
If only there were one for this kind of movie .|1
A peculiar misfire that even Tunney ca n't save .|3
Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .|1
It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .|1
Borstal Boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .|1

Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls .|3
Viewers of Barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .|1
... its stupidities wind up sticking in one 's mind a lot more than the cool bits .|1
I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .|1
The film was n't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .|3
... the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation .|3
Several of Steven Soderbergh 's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist .|1
Hmmm ... might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ?|1
More of a career curio than a major work .|3
The filmmakers might want to look it up .|1
An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .|3
Love Liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit .|1
... tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry .|1
The innocence of holiday cheer ai n't what it used to be .|3
Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .|3
If The Tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit Chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .|1
Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .|1
Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .|1
If the movie were all comedy , it might work better .|1
Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .|1
Big Fat Liar is little more than Home Alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level .|1
Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .|1
This thing is just garbage .|3
A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .|1
An uplifting , largely bogus story .|3
Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .|3
The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .|3
Charming , if overly complicated ...|1
All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .|3
Hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does n't .|1
Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .|1
After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .|1
The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .|1
Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .|3
Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice .|1
I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .|1
Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''|1
Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .|1
The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .|3
Has its charming quirks and its dull spots .|1
The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .|1
You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .|1
But what is missing from it all is a moral .|1
Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .|1
... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .|1
Slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot .|3
The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .|1
This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .|3
It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .|3
When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .|3
It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .|1
It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .|1
Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .|3
What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .|1
It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .|1
One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .|1
The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .|3
I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .|1
Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .|3
So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .|1
Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .|1
Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .|1
A fascinating but choppy documentary .|3
The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .|3
This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .|1
Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .|1
The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .|1
The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .|1
Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?|3
Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .|1
Ruh-roh !|2
A drama ?|2
Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .|3
No. .|2
Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?|1
Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .|1
Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .|1
The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .|1
That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .|1
For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .|3
The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .|1
The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .|1
It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .|1
At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .|1

Was I scared ?|1
The movie is a desperate miscalculation .|3
Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...|1
But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .|3
A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .|1
Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .|3
It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .|1
Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .|1
... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .|1
Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez .|1
It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard -LRB- Eileen Walsh -RRB- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .|1
Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .|3
So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .|1
Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .|1
Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .|1
Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .|1
A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .|3
Two hours of junk .|1
A Blair Witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .|1
Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance|1
The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .|3
`` What John does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .|1
Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film .|3
Generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it 's not without style .|3
He fails .|2
Goes on and on to the point of nausea .|1
One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .|1
... a bland , pretentious mess .|3
A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .|3
It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .|1
The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .|1
Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .|1

A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .|1
The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .|1
He 's not good with people .|1
But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .|1
` Lovely and Amazing , ' unhappily , is neither ... excessively strained and contrived .|3
Amidst the action , the script carries Arnold -LRB- and the viewers -RRB- into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . ''|3
Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .|1
Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .|3
While it is welcome to see a Chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , Lan Yu never catches dramatic fire .|1
The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !|1

... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .|3
The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .|3
The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .|3
An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .|1
The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .|1
The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .|1
Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .|1
Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe .|1
Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !|1
Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .|1

Nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .|1
` A ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .|1
-LRB- E -RRB- ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .|1
In its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of Grease , without benefit of song .|1

Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .|1
Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .|1
Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .|3
Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .|1
An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .|3
If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .|1
There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .|1
We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !|1
Almost gags on its own gore .|1

In the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a rÃ©sumÃ© loaded with credits like `` Girl in Bar # 3 . ''|1
Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .|1
Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence|3
Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .|1
The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .|1
Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .|1
It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .|1
A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .|3
Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .|1
By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .|1
Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .|1

If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .|3
In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .|1
It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .|3
A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .|1
A sequel that 's much too big for its britches .|3
So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .|1
There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .|1
The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .|1
Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface .|1
This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .|1
A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .|3
The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .|1
columns from Ladies Home Journal ...|1

No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .|1
Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .|1

Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter .|1

Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .|3
Leaks treacle from every pore .|3
If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .|1
The film 's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film 's production design .|1

A fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .|3

Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone .|1
but rather , ` How can you charge money for this ? '|1
Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .|3
The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of Scooter .|3
The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .|3

One of those so-so films that could have been much better .|1
Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .|1

Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle .|1

It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .|1
Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .|1
We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .|1
Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .|3
An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension .|1

A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .|3
There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .|1
Been there done that .|1
Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .|1
A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .|1
A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .|3

Seems like someone going through the motions .|1
Well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .|1
Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .|1
A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .|1
brought to life on the big screen .|1
Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .|1

It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .|1
For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .|1
... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .|3
A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '|1
Stress ` dumb . '|1
The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .|3
Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .|1
Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .|1
Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .|1

` Hey Arnold ! '|1
Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .|1
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .|1
A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .|3
A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .|1
It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .|1
One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .|1

The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''|3
As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music .|3

Go for La Salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .|1
What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .|1
Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .|1

is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .|1
Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .|1

The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .|3
Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me .|1
A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .|1
Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .|1
And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .|1
Dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .|1
Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .|1
Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .|1
Apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present Hollywood program .|1
Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .|1
A movie that 's held captive by mediocrity .|3
What 's next ?|1
It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .|1
It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .|1
It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .|3

These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .|1
Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .|1
The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .|1
A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .|1
It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .|1
The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .|1
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .|1
A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .|1
Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .|1
The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''|1
Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .|1
The camera twirls !|1
Oh , look at that clever angle !|1

Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .|1
-LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .|3
A ragbag of cliches .|1
The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .|1

One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .|1
We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .|1
` Would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? '|1
The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .|3
The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .|1
Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .|3
An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .|3
The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .|3
It 's not original enough .|1
I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .|1
It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .|1
With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .|1
`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .|1
Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .|1
Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .|3
Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .|1
Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .|3
Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .|1
McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .|3
A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .|3
A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .|3
The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .|1
Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .|1
The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .|3
Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .|1
It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .|1
An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .|3
It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .|1
It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .|1
Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .|1
A decidedly mixed bag .|1
The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .|3
Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .|1
Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- better films .|3
Even kids deserve better .|1
... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .|1
`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .|1
Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .|3
Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .|1
But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort|1
Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .|1
What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .|3
Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .|1
None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .|1
The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .|1
As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .|1
`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .|1
While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .|1
As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .|3
Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .|1
The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .|1
It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .|1
This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .|1
Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...|1
Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .|3
Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .|1
Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .|1
Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .|3
Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .|3
All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .|1
-LRB- A -RRB- stale retread of the '53 original .|3
Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders .|1
Low comedy does n't come much lower .|3
Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .|1
One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .|1
Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears .|1
The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .|1
Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .|3
The film 's most improbable feat ?|3
It did n't go straight to video .|1
Whether Quitting will prove absorbing to American audiences is debatable .|1
Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .|1
Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .|1
A Movie to Forget|1
The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .|1
Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .|1
Witless and utterly pointless .|1
With a `` Spy Kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` SNL '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni ?|3
Instead of trying to bust some blondes , -LRB- Diggs -RRB- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .|1
Dismally dull sci-fi comedy .|1
The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock .|3
The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .|1
Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .|1
I 've never seen -LRB- a remake -RRB- do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates Frank Capra 's classic ...|1
Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .|3
Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie : Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .|1
There 's some outrageously creative action in The Transporter ... -LRB- b -RRB- ut by the time Frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman .|3
Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .|1
An ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .|3
This Sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama .|1
It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''|1
In a strange way , Egoyan has done too much .|3
He 's worked too hard on this movie .|1
The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .|3
A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing .|1
Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .|1
There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .|1
Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .|1
Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .|1
